# CAR PARKING MANAGEMENT

      A parking management system refers to the innovative technologies providing solutions in the parking industry. The core idea behind any 
parking management system is self-explanatory.
      
      It’s a system that helps people, companies, and organizations to manage their parking spaces.
      
      Managing car parks isn’t an easy task for companies and organizations because there are lots of moving parts including traffic and 
the availability of spaces. It is a time-consuming task, requires human labor, and is inefficient. Using a parking management system can 
help reduce a business’s administrative overhead on parking and reduce the impact of their parking space on their local communication.
